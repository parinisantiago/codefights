#Let's call a list beautiful if its first element is equal to its last element, or if a list is empty. Given a list a, your task is to chop off its first and its last element until it becomes beautiful. Implement a function that will make the given a beautiful as described, and return the resulting list as an answer.

def listBeautifier(a):
    res = a[:]
    while res and res[0] != res[-1]:
        a, *res, c = res
    return res
