#One of your friends has an awful writing style: he almost never starts a message with a capital letter, but adds uppercase letters in random places throughout the message. It makes chatting with him very difficult for you, so you decided to write a plugin that will change each message received from your friend into a more readable form.

#Implement a function that will change the very first symbol of the given message to uppercase, and make all the other letters lowercase.

def fixMessage(message):
    return message.capitalize()
